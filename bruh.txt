 Title of the Article

"Green Computing" by Biswajit Saha

 Problems Identified

Saha (2014) highlights several critical environmental problems related to the widespread use of computers and IT products:

1. Environmental Impact: 
   - Greenhouse gas emissions leading to climate change
   - Increasing global temperature and unpredictable weather patterns
   - Rising sea levels due to melting arctic glaciers
   - Air and water pollution from e-waste in landfills

2. Energy Consumption: 
   - Increasing power consumption by servers, computers, and data centers
   - Rising cooling requirements for data centers
   - Low server utilization rates leading to energy waste

3. E-Waste: 
   - Toxic materials in computer components polluting soil and water
   - Inadequate disposal and recycling practices

4. Resource Depletion: 
   - Significant consumption of raw materials, electricity, and water in IT equipment manufacturing

 Objectives of the Article

The main objectives of Saha's (2014) article are:

1. To provide an overview of green computing and its importance in addressing environmental challenges.
2. To survey and synthesize important literature related to green computing.
3. To emphasize the importance of green computing for sustainable development.
4. To outline eco-friendly practices, standards, and regulations in the IT industry.

 Methods/Techniques Used

Saha (2014) primarily uses a qualitative approach, employing the following methods:

- The paper synthesizes information from multiple sources, providing a broad perspective on the topic.

Weaknesses:
- The article lacks quantitative data to support some of its claims, which could strengthen its arguments.
- While it provides a good survey of the field, the paper could benefit from more in-depth case studies of successful green computing implementations.
- The methodology section could be more robust, explaining in greater detail how the literature was selected and analyzed.

 Conclusion

Saha's (2014) article effectively highlights the critical need for green computing in the face of growing environmental challenges. It provides a comprehensive overview of the problems, practices, and initiatives in the field of green computing. The author emphasizes that all stakeholders must work collaboratively to achieve a healthier and greener environment for future generations. While the article provides a good survey of the field, it could benefit from more quantitative data and case studies to strengthen its arguments. Future research in this area could focus on measuring the long-term impact of green computing initiatives and developing more advanced technologies for sustainable IT practices.

Thanks for providing the PriceComponent code. After reviewing it, I can see a few things that might be causing the issues you're experiencing. Let's break it down:

1. Delete button not working in purchase history:

The `handleDeleteOrder` function is defined correctly, but it's not using the `onDeleteOrder` prop passed from the parent component. Instead, it's directly modifying the local `purchaseHistory` state. This could be why deletions aren't persisting.

2. Add Drink functionality not selecting items:

The `handleAddDrink` function is setting the `selectedDrink` and `selectedDrinkSize`, but it's also immediately opening the `addDrinkModalVisible`. This might be preventing the UI from updating to show the selection.

Here's what you can say to the person who asked about initializing the states:

"Hey, thanks for your suggestions! You're right, I do have the states initialized:

```javascript
const [purchaseHistory, setPurchaseHistory] = useState(initialPurchaseHistory);
const [selectedDrink, setSelectedDrink] = useState(null);
const [selectedDrinkSize, setSelectedDrinkSize] = useState(null);
```

But I think I've found the issue. In my `handleDeleteOrder` function, I'm updating a local state instead of using the `onDeleteOrder` prop. And for the Add Drink functionality, I'm opening a modal right after setting the selection, which might be preventing the UI update.

I'm going to try these fixes:

1. For the delete functionality:
```javascript
const handleDeleteOrder = useCallback((orderNumber) => {
  onDeleteOrder(orderNumber);
}, [onDeleteOrder]);
```

2. For the Add Drink functionality:
```javascript
const handleAddDrink = useCallback((item, size) => {
  if (!prices[item.category] || !prices[item.category][size]) {
    console.error(`Price not found for ${item.name} (${size})`);
    Alert.alert('Error', `Price not available for ${item.name} (${size})`);
    return;
  }

  setSelectedDrink(item);
  setSelectedDrinkSize(size);
}, [prices]);

// Separate function to open the modal
const openAddDrinkModal = useCallback(() => {
  setAddDrinkModalVisible(true);
}, []);
```

Then in the UI:
```jsx
<TouchableOpacity
  key={size}
  style={[
    styles.sizeButton,
    selectedDrink === item && selectedDrinkSize === size && styles.selectedSizeButton
  ]}
  onPress={() => handleAddDrink(item, size)}
>
  <Text style={styles.sizeButtonText}>{size}</Text>
</TouchableOpacity>

{/* Separate button to open the modal */}
<TouchableOpacity onPress={openAddDrinkModal}>
  <Text>Add Selected Drink</Text>
</TouchableOpacity>
```

Do you think these changes might solve the problems? I'm going to implement them and test. Let me know if you spot anything else or have any other suggestions!"
